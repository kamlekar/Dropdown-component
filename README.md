###Found Bugs:

- In initial state, when clicked on arrow state icon, the dropdown is empty instead of showing the first option.
- Pressing up or down keyboard function doesn't do anything.
- When the dropdown list is scrolled to down and after that if closed and open the dropdown again, the scroll state is at the bottom instead of being at top. [critical]
